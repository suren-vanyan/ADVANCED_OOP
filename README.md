### Description :pushpin:
 ASP.NET Core MVC is a radical shift for web developers using the Microsoft platform. It emphasizes
clean architecture, design patterns, and testability, and it doesnâ€™t try to conceal how the Web works.
 The first part of this book is designed to help you understand broadly the foundational ideas of
MVC development, including the new features in ASP.NET Core MVC, and to experience in practice
what the framework is like to use.
